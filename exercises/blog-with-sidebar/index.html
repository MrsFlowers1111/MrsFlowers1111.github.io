                    India Arie Simpson (sometimes styled as india.arie) 
                    (born October 3, 1975) is an American singer and songwriter.
                    Her debut album, Acoustic Soul, was released in 2001, and 
                    she has since released six more studio albums. Arie has sold
                    over five million records in the US and ten million

                    nominations, including Best R&B Album.

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    India was born in Denver, the daughter of Joyce and Ralph
                    Simpson. Her musical skills were encouraged by both parents 
                    in her younger years. Her mother is a former singer (she was
                    signed to Motown as a teenager and opened for Stevie Wonder 
                    and Al Green) and has become Arie's stylist. She has an 
                    older brother named J'On and younger sister Mary A Martin of
                    Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Arie is African-American, 
                    and according to a DNA analysis, she descends from the Mende
                    people of Sierra Leone, the Kru people of Liberia and the 
                    Fula people of Guinea-Bissau.

                <p>
                    After Arie's parents divorced, her mother moved the family 
                    to Atlanta when India was 13. Arie's had taken up a 
                    succession of musical instruments throughout her schooling 
                    in Denver. But her interest in the guitar, while attending 
                    the Savannah College of Art and Design, led to a personal 
                    revelation about songwriting and performing. "When I started 
                    tapping into my own sensitivity, I started to understand 
                    people better. It was a direct result of writing songs", she 
                    said at the press release of her debut album, Acoustic Soul.

                    Co-founding the Atlanta-based independent music collective 
                    Government Earthseed (Government was the collective artists' 
                    name and Earthseed was their independent label name), her 
                    one-song turn on a locally released compilation led to a 
                    second-stage gig at the 1998 Lilith Fair. In 1999, a 
                    Universal/Motown music scout signed her and made an 
                    introduction to former Motown CEO Kedar Massenburg. Arie 
                    resided in New York City for over a decade, before moving 
                    back to Atlanta to focus on her career and music. .
                    Named to Oprah Winfrey's SuperSoul100 list of visionaries 
                    and influential leaders,[9] India.Arie performed 
                    Songversation during 2017 motivational cruises.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Arie released her debut album Acoustic Soul on March 27, 
                    2001. The album was met with positive reviews and commercial 
                    success. Acoustic Soul debuted at number ten on the U.S. 
                    Billboard 200 and number three on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop 
                    Albums. Within months, without the concentrated radio 
                    airplay that typically powers pop and rap albums, Acoustic 
                    Soul was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry 
                    Association of America (RIAA), selling 2,180,000 copies in 
                    the U.S. and 3,000,000 copies worldwide. The album was also 
                    certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry and 
                    platinum by Music Canada.[14] The album was promoted with 
                    the release of the lead single "Video". "Video" attained 
                    commercial success peaking at 47 on the US Billboard Hot 100 
                    and becoming her highest-charting song in the region to 
                    date. The album's second single "Brown Skin" failed to chart
                    on the Billboard Hot 100, but it became her highest-charting 
                    single in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 29.

                    Arie performed a duet with rock singer-guitarist John 
                    Mellencamp on the song "Peaceful World" for his 2001 album 
                    Cuttin' Heads. While Arie and the album were nominated for 
                    seven Grammy awards in 2002, they won no awards, losing in 
                    five of seven categories to Alicia Keys. She closed the 
                    ceremony with a performance of her song "Video". 
                    Arie performed a duet with jazz singer Cassandra Wilson on 
                    the song "Just Another Parade" for her 2002 album Belly of 
                    the Sun.

                    Arie followed the success of her debut on September 24, 
                    2002, with the release of Voyage to India. It debuted at 
                    number six on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of 
                    109,000 copies and topped the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, with 
                    the RIAA certifying it Platinum. At the 2003 Grammy Awards, 
                    it won Best R&B Album, and the single "Little Things" won 
                    Best Urban/Alternative Performance. The song "Get It 
                    Together" was featured on many film soundtracks including 
                    Brown Sugar (2002) and Shark Tale (2004).
