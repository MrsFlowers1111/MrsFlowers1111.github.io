        <h4>SYNOPSIS</h4>
        <p>
            During the height of the conflict in World War II circa 1943, 
            difficulties in the war led to a change in priorities, and much 
            of the mail previously reaching soldiers on the front lines has 
            been halted. As warehouses begin to overflow with unfulfilled 
            deliveries, soldiers' hopes are dashed as they lose contact with
            their families back home. To fix this problem, the 6888th 
            Battalion the Women's Army Corps' all-Black battalion including 
            over 800 female soldiers is sent to tackle the impossible 
            challenge of sorting years' worth of backlogged mail. Even as 
            military higher-ups hope to see the plan fail, the Six Triple 
            Eight are determined to deliver hope to soldiers and families 
            across the world.
